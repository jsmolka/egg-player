# Things to do

## Rework
- BarWidget
  - update name if the current audio changes
  - properly split into subclasses
- create thin and thick bass wrapper
  - use different names for stream / error

## Database
- proper query binding

## Filesystem Rework
- make it more robust
- split into more and better classes
- prevent crashes when adding lots of files

## User Interface
### Bar
- use different sliders for volume and duration and volume
  - make the volume slider pop out instead of hiding other icons
  - improve the duration slider style (include some form of hover effect)

### Library
- create an expandable scrollbar for the library
  - show the current alphabet letter
- adjust appearance of library items
  - consider using a less "bright" white for less contrast
- improve smooth scrolling
  - maybe higher refresh rate
  - make it work properly on mouse and touchpad
- fix the bug where only one column is highlighted
