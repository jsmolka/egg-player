# Things to do

## Threading
- possibly rewrite threading
- create a threadpool to recycle threads
- try using multiple workers per thread
- create an easy abstract class to run objects in threads
  
## User interface
- do not show certain info at low size
- fuzzy library searching
- [expand scrollbar](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23677355/7057528)
- [scrollable text](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10655396/7057528)

## Possible future changes
- do not cache loaded covers, calculate dominant color right after first load and store for id
- test jpg instead of png for cover caching
- QSet vs QVector for files in Directory
