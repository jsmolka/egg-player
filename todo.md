- update qt creator
- [use clang features](http://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/07/18/qt-creator-4-7-0-released/)
- consider using a set for audios, see [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/a/25524075)

## Threading
- possibly rewrite threading
- create a threadpool to recycle threads
- try using multiple workers per thread
- create an easy abstract class to run objects in threads
  
## User interface
- do not show certain info at low size

## Possible future changes
