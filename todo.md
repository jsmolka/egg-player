# Things to do

## User Interface

### Bar
- use different sliders for volume and duration
  - make the volume slider pop out instead of hiding other icons
  - improve the duration slider style (include some form of hover effect)
  - create a unique handle for the duration slider
- update the track label if the played audio has been modified
- consider splitting into more subclasses
- fade cover through black when changing the audio
- create an AudioFinder class which handles keystrokes
  - create keyReset config field

### Library
- make the scrollbar expandable
- adjust the appearance of library items
  - consider using a less bright white
  - consider using a slightly smaller font size
- add vertical black bars to the library border
- improve smooth scrolling
